# Initial Interaction Notes

Overall as the designer of this, I am biased in that I like it as a process.
I believe it will be useful to teams and enable accellerated onboarding when used effectively.

I will be using this as a process going forward, in various different ways as part of research and development.

I also feel that it will help many product groups gain feedback as well as others in mapping thier feedback to that which has been provided by others as can be linked to quite easily.

## Things to Improve

What format to use for the ID and filename for IIN's
These need to be unique and easily parsed and searchable & Contain at first glance all required information
